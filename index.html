            <h2>About</h2>
            <!-- Rounded switch -->
            <p>Short Version Switch | Feeling like reading Version</p>
            <p>I am a multi-disciplinary designer with a degree in digital design and more than 10-year experience. I've
                been building great, meaningful, easy-to-use products, creating design systems, and leading teams. I
                strive for quality and positive change in everything I do while having fun during the process.</p>
            <blockquote>Nilson played a key role in leading the creation of our company's first Design System.
                Additionally, he was responsible for designing highly usable software products in the innovative areas of online
                ballot delivery, online voting and central counting.</blockquote>
            <small>— Nicole Brlek - Head of Product and Marketing at Smartmatic</small>
            <p>I always go beyond the task I am given. I help to define, influence and build product vision and
                strategy. I work collaboratively with partners across teams and functions. Asking the right questions and helping my
                team to understand the problem, its context, and how it fits in a bigger picture. I started my career in
                the advertising industry. That helped me develop strong visual and motion design skills to produce, build,
                and ship products that people will love to see and use.</p>
            <p>I am a flexible professional that is comfortable working in a fast-paced environment and under pressure.
                I know how and when to balance pixel perfect and get things done. Years of experience have given me
                professional and personal maturity to receive and provide feedback, communicate and persuade others
                about my design decisions, and learn upon my mistakes.</p>
            <blockquote>He has been my mentor from the moment I joined the UX team at Smartmatic. Nilson has a great
                ability to teach and inspire you through a thoughtful delivery of his expertise, identifying someone's strengths
                and where to help them improve.</blockquote>
            <small>— Gabriela Gandica - UX Manager at Smartmatic</small>
            <p>I had the pleasure of working with people and businesses worldwide, such as the UK, USA, Denmark,
                Estonia, Panama, Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina. That makes me comfortable working in a variety of industries
                and collaborating with multicultural audiences.</p>
            <p>I have been working remotely for the past 3-years as a freelancer. During this time, I have successfully
                performed and participated in design and sprint activities remotely.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I am into photography, woodwork, and DIY projects. Oh! And I am also a full-time father
                of 2 beautiful kids.</p>
